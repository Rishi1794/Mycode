Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)


Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant

In this coding model we ahve used logistic regression model in order to predict the 'diagnosis' of breast cance r based on the various factors
